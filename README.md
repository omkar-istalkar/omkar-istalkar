## 🔭 About Me

- Passionate about building interactive web apps and immersive 3D experiences.  
- Skilled in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **Three.js**, **Blender**, and **WebGL**.  
- In my free time, I create 3D animated short films, visualizations, and web-based graphics for both fun and client projects.  
- I love optimizing performance and building scalable systems — whether it's a game engine prototype or a production web app.

## 💼 My Work

Here are a few highlights of my key projects and contributions:

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| **3D Animation Playground** | A web app built with **Three.js** and **React** that allows users to build and animate 3D scenes using pre-built assets. Integrated a physics engine (Cannon.js) for realistic interactions. |
| **Interactive Data Visualizer** | A dashboard that visualizes complex datasets in 3D — using WebGL for rendering vector fields, volumetric data, and animated transitions. |
| **Animated Short Film: *Digital Dawn*** | A 2-minute 3D animated short film made in **Blender**, featuring a sci-fi cityscape, particle effects, and lighting animations. Rendered using Eevee and optimized for web delivery. |
| **Food Delivery System (MERN)** | Full-stack web application for food ordering. Built server APIs in **Node.js** / **Express**, and frontend in **React** with real-time order tracking. |
| **LeetCode Solutions Repository** | A curated list of my LeetCode problem solutions (in JavaScript/TypeScript), focusing on data structures, algorithms, and system design.

## 🎮 3D Animation & Visuals

I’ve worked on several 3D animation and visualization projects, including:

- Procedural city generation — using Blender + Three.js, generating buildings, animated traffic, and day/night cycles.  
- Particle simulations synced to music — visualizing beats and melodies via WebGL particles.  
- Interactive WebGL scenes — users can manipulate lights, camera, and objects in real time.

## 🌱 What I’m Learning

- Advanced **shader programming** (GLSL) to create custom effects in WebGL  
- **Machine learning for graphics** — generative models for procedural content  
- Building **VR / AR experiences** using WebXR and Three.js

## ✨ Fun Facts

- I once built a **3D sound visualizer** that changes geometry in real-time based on audio frequencies.  
- I love sci-fi — my dream project is to animate a short film about space exploration.  
- I started coding when I was 15, and 3D animation when I was 18.
