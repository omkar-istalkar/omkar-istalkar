# Hi, I’m **Omkar Istalkar** 👋

**Software Engineer • 3D Animator • Full-Stack Developer**

## 🔭 About Me

- I build both **web apps** and **interactive 3D experiences** — combining my love for engineering and design.  
- My tech stack includes **JavaScript / TypeScript**, **React**, **Node.js**, **Three.js**, **WebGL**, and **Blender**.  
- I enjoy working on physics simulations, real-time visualizations, and optimizing graphics for web.  
- Outside coding, I create 3D animated scenes & short films, and explore shader programming to push web graphics boundaries.

## 💼 Key Projects & Work

Here are some of the projects I've passionately worked on (or contributed to):

| Project | What I Did |
|---|---|
| **3D Animation Playground** | Built a web-based sandbox (using **Three.js + React**) where users can place, animate, and simulate 3D objects. Implemented physics (via Cannon.js), lighting controls, and custom material shaders. |
| **Procedural City Generator** | A Blender + Three.js pipeline to procedurally generate city scenes: modular buildings, animated traffic, day/night cycle, and volumetric lighting. |
| **Interactive Data Viz Dashboard** | Created a dashboard that visualizes large datasets in 3D — rendering vector fields, volumetric heatmaps, and animated transitions via **WebGL**. |
| **Animated Short Film – “Neon Horizon”** | A 90-second sci-fi short made in **Blender**, featuring a neon cityscape, particle systems, and a camera fly-through. Rendered using Eevee and composited for web delivery. |
| **MERN Food-Order App** | Built a full-stack web app (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) for ordering and tracking food deliveries in real time. Implemented user authentication, order tracking, and admin panel. |
| **Algorithm & DS Library** | Maintained a personal repo of data-structure & algorithm solutions (in JS/TS), with explanations and visualizations.

## 🎨 3D Animation & Graphics Highlights

- **Procedural Environments:** Built modular city generation that adapts to user input (street layout, building density, style).  
- **Custom Shaders:** Wrote GLSL shaders for water, neon-glow, and procedural noise-based materials.  
- **Particle Systems:** Created music-synced particle animations (e.g., visualizers) that react in real time via Web Audio + WebGL.  
- **Camera Animations:** Designed smooth camera paths / transitions in Three.js, with easing functions, depth of field, and cinematic framing.

## 🌱 What I’m Exploring

- **WebXR / AR / VR** — building immersive experiences for browsers with Three.js + WebXR.  
- **Machine-Learning in Graphics** — exploring generative models (e.g. GANs) to auto-generate 3D assets / textures.  
- **Advanced Shader Effects** — delving deeper into procedural shaders, ray marching, and real-time post-processing.  
- **Real-time Collaboration Tools** — working on multi-user 3D scene editors with real-time sync.

## ✨ Fun Facts

- I once made a mini 3D game inside Three.js where objects respond to your voice!  
- My favorite Blender render to date was a cyberpunk alley with reflective puddles and neon signs.  
- When I was a kid, I used to draw city skylines — now I build them in 3D.
